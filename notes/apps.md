# Apps. We could call this a "service"


We expose some kind of interface for others to "drive" - to access our functionality.

How we *implement* that is none of their business. This is "abstraction" and "encapsulation" from computer science 101.


If you use our "app" to create an order, it will work. 

We prefer early bound stuff 

But we can do late bound.
