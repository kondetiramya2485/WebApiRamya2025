# Products.Api to Orders.Api

## Products:

When a new product is added or updated, we'll let you know.

When it is removed, we'll let you know.

## Orders:

Cool. Thanks. We'll subscribe to your topic.

Oh, and I guess we should let you know when someone buys something.

## Products:

Yeah, let us know. We'll remove it from our inventory.

Uh, there _could_ be a time when you are working from an old product listing.

What do you want us to do?
